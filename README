This repo contains data and code pertaining to analysis of mental health and it’s predictors. It was created by Alen Mitrovski.

The survey and subsequent dataset cannot be shared in this public repo due to legal reasons. However, in order to obtain this dataset, you can follow the steps below:

-	Visit the CHASS website at http://www.chass.utoronto.ca/ . On the left-hand set of tabs, hover over “Data Centres” using your cursor and click on the “U. of T. users” tab that will appear (Note: Click on “other institutions” if you are not part of the University of Toronto faculty or students). You will be redirected to the CHASS Data Centres page. Now, click on the “SDA @ CHASS” tab on the left-hand set of tabs. You will be prompted to enter your UTORid. You will be redirected to a page asking you to select English or French language. Choose appropriately. 

-	You will be redirected to a page of listed surveys. Scroll down to the “C” section where you will find the “Canadian Community Health Surveys (CCHS)”. Click on the link. You will be redirected to a list of CCHS surveys. The first row represents the 2017-2018 survey used in this study. The “Documentation” link on the right-hand side will take you to a page consisting of the user guide, complementary information, the questionnaire, data dictionary, derived variables and quality assurance guidelines. The other “Data” link will redirect you to a page where you can click the “Download  Customize Subset” tab on the top ribbon of the page.
-	Here, you must select “CSV” for the data file and STATA for the data definitions. At the bottom of the page, you can enter the variables of interest. In this case, you can select all variables as they will be cleaned afterwards. Click “continue” at the bottom of this page and you will be able to download your data file, codebook and STATA file. 

The inputs folder of this repo contains the dataset from the Canadian Community Health Survey for 2017-2018. In addition, it also contains the cleaning file. The dataset from the CHASS website was cleaned and overwritten to fit the needs of this research. This can be performed with the Cleaning_Mental_Health.Rmd file in the inputs folder. The key variables of the study are selected, their N/A results are filtered out and their format is altered to fit the needs of the coding process.
